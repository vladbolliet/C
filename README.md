How the Chocolate Game Works

Setup:

You start with a rectangular chocolate tablet.
One of the corners of the tablet is protected (also called the green 1x1 piece).

Goal:

Avoid being the player forced to take the green square (the last remaining piece, 1x1).

Gameplay:

Players take turns cutting the chocolate tablet.
On your turn, you must:
Choose to cut a row or a column.
Select the exact position of the cut.

What Happens After a Cut:

When you cut a row or a column, all rows/columns beyond the cut, opposite from the green square, disappear.

Rules:

Cuts must be straight along a single row or column.
The green square must remain in the resulting piece.

Winning and Losing:

The player forced to take the green square (when only 1x1 remains) loses the game.


Observations about the code

A random rectangular tablet between 2x2 and 10x10 is generated at the beginning of the game.

Normal squares are represented by 0, green square is represented by 1, eaten/unavailable squares are represented by "-".
